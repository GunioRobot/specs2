This version adds new features on top of 1.4:

 * datatables are now formatted as html tables when using the HtmlRunner (issue 22)
 * added some implicit conversions to allow a better reuse of Given/When/Then steps with variant types
 * added a `specs2.whitebg` property to specify a white background and get a better color scheme in the console
  
And some fixes:

 * fixed issue 20: reflection error when using maven/surefire
 * added back the possibility to use the example description in the example body
 * fixed issue 23 (specification of system properties)
 * fixed a missing quote in the documentation messing up the layout
 * fixed a time formatting issue when > 1 hour in the statistics
 * changed the API so that `org.specs2.reporter.Colors` and `org.specs2.reporter.ConsoleColors` switch names for better abstraction
