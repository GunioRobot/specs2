/**
 * A Reporter will report the execution of a Specification following 3 steps:
 *
 * 1. an extraction of the Fragments to report (like creating Descriptions for JUnit)
 *   - filtering out some elements if necessary
 *
 * 2. an ordering of the Fragments to execute:
 *   - action steps must be executed in order
 *   - dependency between Fragments can be specified
 *   - other Fragments can be executed concurrently (unless specified otherwise)
 *
 * 3. a reporting to:
 *   - the console (ConsoleRunner or sbt)
 *   - a listener object (junit or sbt)
 *   - a file (html, xml, junit-report)
