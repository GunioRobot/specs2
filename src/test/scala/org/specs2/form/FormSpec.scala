A Form is a generic table which has an optional title and rows. Each row contains cells which can be created from
Fields, Props or other Forms.

A Form is usually created in a specification with expected values so that it can be displayed with the rest of the text
(whereas a DataTable is only displayed when there are failures. It is then "implemented" with actual values in an example.
Upon execution a Form will return a Result value summarizing the execution of each Prop it embeds.
