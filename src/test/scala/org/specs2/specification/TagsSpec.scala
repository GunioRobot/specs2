A specification can be tagged with some meaningful names like "integration" or "accounts". Creating tags amounts to
adding new fragments in the specification. Then those fragments are used to determine which other fragments must be executed
during the specification execution. There are 2 types of tags for marking a single fragment or a full range of fragments:

 * `TaggedAs(name1, name2,...)` marks the previous fragment as tagged with the given names
 * `Tag(name1, name2,...)` marks the next fragment as tagged with the given names

 * `AsSection(name1, name2,...)` marks the previous fragment and the next as tagged with the given names,
    until the next `Section(name1, name2)` tag
 * `Section(name1, name2,...)` marks the next fragments as tagged with the given names, until the next `Section(name1, name2)` tag
