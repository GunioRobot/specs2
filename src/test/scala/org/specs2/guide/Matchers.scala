There are many ways to define expectations in ***specs2***. You can define expectations with anything that returns
a `Result`:

  * Boolean
  * Standard result
  * Matcher result
  * Scalacheck property
  * Mock expectation
  * DataTable
  * Forms

### Boolean results

This is the simplest kind of result you can define for an expectation but also the least expressive!

Here's an example:

    "This is hopefully true"         ! (1 != 2)

This can be useful for simple expectations but a failure will give few information on what went wrong:

    "This is hopefully true"         ! (2 != 2) // fails with 'the value is false',...

### Standard results

Some standard results can be used when you need specific result meanings:

  * `success`: the example is ok
  * `failure`: there is a non-met expectation
  * `anError`: a non-expected exception occurred
  * `skipped`: the example is skipped possibly at runtime because some conditions are not met. A more specific message can
    be created with `Skipped("my message")`
  * `pending`: usually means "not implemented yet", but a specific message can be created with `Pending("my message")`

Two additional results are also available to track the progress of features:

  * `done`: a `Success` with the message "DONE"
  * `todo`: a `Pending` with the message "TODO"

### Match results

This is by far the largest category of Results in ***specs2***. They cover many data types, can be composed and adapted to
create new ones or be created from scratch by the user. Let's have a look at some of them and refer the reader to the
API for the complete list:

 * Matchers for Any
 * Option / Either matchers
 * String matchers
 * Numeric matchers
 * Exception matchers
 * Iterable matchers
 * Map matchers
 * Xml matchers
 * Json matchers
 * File matchers
 * Scalaz matchers
 * Result matchers
 * Interpreter matchers
 * Parsers matchers

#### Matchers for Any

The most common type of matcher is `beEqualTo` to test for equality. There are different ways to use this matcher:

       1 must beEqualTo(1)
       1 must be_==(1)            // with a shorter matcher
       1 must_== 1                // my favorite!
       1 mustEqual 1              // if you dislike underscores
       1 should_== 1              // for should lovers
       1 === 1                    // the ultimate shortcut
       1 must be equalTo(1)       // with a literate style

       1 must not be equalTo(2)   // with a negation
       1 must_!= 2                // with a negation
       1 mustNotEqual 2           // with a negation
       1 must be_!=(2)            // with a negation
       1 !== 2                    // with a negation

The `beEqualTo` matcher is using the regular `==` Scala equality. However in the case of `Arrays`, Scala `==` is just using reference equality, `eq`, for `Arrays`. So the `beEqualTo` matcher has been adapted to transform `Arrays` to `Seqs` before checking for equality, so that `Array(1, 2, 3) === Array(1, 2, 3)` (despite the fact that `Array(1, 2, 3) != Array(1, 2, 3)`).

You can see on the examples above several things which are applicable to all matchers:

 * the general form for using a matcher is `a must matcher`
 * you can use `should` instead of `must` if you prefer
 * there are only 2 shortcuts provided because the equality matcher is so ubiquitous `must_==` and `===`
 * for most of the matchers you can use a form where the ` be` word (or the `have` word) is detached
 * you can as well negate a matcher by adding not before it (or after it, as a method call)

An non-exhaustive list of those matchers:

 * `be_===` for checking if `a == b` where a and b are expected to have the same type by the compiler
 * `be_==~` for checking if `(a:A) == (b:A)` when there is an implicit conversion from B (the type of b) to A (the type of a)
 * `beTheSameAs` for checking if `a eq b` (`a must be(b)` also works)
 * `beTrue, beFalse`
 * `beLike { case exp => ok }`: to check if an object is like a given pattern (`ok` is a predefined value, `ko` is the opposite)
 * `beLike { case exp => exp must beXXX }`: to check if an object is like a given pattern, and verifies a condition
 * `beNull`
 * `beAsNullAs`: when 2 objects must be null at the same time if one of them is null
 * `beOneOf(a, b, c)`: to check if an object is one of a given list
 * `haveClass`: to check the class of an object
 * `haveSuperclass`: to check if the class of an object as another class as one of its ancestors
 * `beAssignableFrom`: to check if a class is assignable from another
 * `beAnInstanceOf[T]`: to check if an object is an instance of type `T`

 #### With a better description

Most of the time, the message displayed in the case of a matcher failure is clear enough. However a bit more information
is sometimes necessary to get a better diagnostic on the value that's being checked. Let's say that you want to check a
"ticket list":

      // will fail with "List(ticket1, ticket2) doesn't have size 3" for example
      machine.tickets must have size(3) // machine is a user-defined object

If you wish to get a more precise failure message you can set an alias with the `aka` method (*also known as*):

      // will fail with "the created tickets 'List(ticket1, ticket2)' doesn't have size 3"
      machine.tickets aka "the created tickets" must haveSize(3)

There is also a shortcut for `value aka value.toString` which is simply `value.aka`.

And when you want to other ways to customize the description, you can use:

 * `post`: `"a" post " is the first letter"` prints `a is the first letter`
 * `as`: `"b" as ((s:String) => "a"+s+"c")` prints `abc`


#### Matchers creation

There are many ways to create matchers for your specific usage. The simplest way is to reuse the existing ones:

 * using logical operators

        def beBetween(i: Int, j: Int) = be_>=(i) and be_<=(j)

        // create a Seq Matcher from a Matcher
        def allBeGreaterThan2: Matcher[Seq[Int]]   = be_>=(2).forall     // fail after the first failure
        def allBeGreaterThan3: Matcher[Seq[Int]]   = be_>=(2).foreach    // like forall but execute all matchers and collect the results
        def haveOneGreaterThan2: Matcher[Seq[Int]] = be_>=(2).atLeastOnce

 * adapting the actual value. This matcher adapts the existing `be_<=` matcher to a matcher applicable to `Any`

        def beShort = be_<=(5) ^^ { (t: Any) => t.toString.size }

 * adapting the actual and expected values. This matcher compares 2 `Human` objects but set their `wealth` field to 0
   so that the equals method will not fail on that field:

        def beMostlyEqualTo = (be_==(_:Human)) ^^^ ((_:Human).copy(wealth = 0))
        // then
        Human(age = 20, wealth=1000) must beMostlyEqualTo(Human(age = 20, wealth=1)) toResult // success

 * using `eventually` to try a match a number of times until it succeeds:

        val iterator = List(1, 2, 3).iterator
        iterator.next must be_==(3).eventually
         // Use eventually(retries, n.millis) to use another number of tries and waiting time

 * using `when` or `unless` to apply a matcher only if a condition is satisfied:

        1 must be_==(2).when(false)                        // will return a success
        1 must be_==(2).unless(true)                       // same thing

        1 must be_==(2).when(false, "don't check this")    // will return a success
        1 must be_==(2).unless(true, "don't check this")   // same thing

 * using `iff` to say that a matcher must succeed if and only if a condition is satisfied:

        1 must be_==(1).iff(true)                        // will return a success
        1 must be_==(2).iff(true)                        // will return a failure
        1 must be_==(2).iff(false)                       // will return a success
        1 must be_==(1).iff(false)                       // will return a failure

 * using `orSkip` to return a `Skipped` result instead of a Failure if the condition is not met

        1 must be_==(2).orSkip
        1 must be_==(2).orSkip("Precondition failed")  // prints "Precondition failed: '1' is not equal to '2'"

 * using `mute` to change a Matcher so that it returns MatchResults with no messages. This is used in Forms to create
   properties showing no messages when they fail

Another easy way to create matchers, is to use some implicit conversions from functions to Matchers:

       val m: Matcher[String]  = ((_: String).startsWith("hello"), "doesn't start with hello")
       val m1: Matcher[String] = ((_: String).startsWith("hello"), "starts with hello", "doesn't start with hello")
       val m2: Matcher[String] = ((_: String).startsWith("hello"), (s:String) => s+ " doesn't start with hello")
       val m3: Matcher[String] = ((_: String).startsWith("hello"), (s:String) => s+ " starts with hello", (s:String) => s+ " doesn't start with hello")
       val m4: Matcher[String] = (s: String) => (s.startsWith("hello"), s+" doesn't start with hello")
       val m5: Matcher[String] = (s: String) => (s.startsWith("hello"), s+ "starts with hello", s+ " doesn't start with hello")

And if you want absolute power over matching, you can define your own matcher:

      class MyOwn extends Matcher[String] {
        def apply[S <: String](s: Expectable[S]) = {
          result(s.value.isEmpty,
                 s.description + " is empty",
                 s.description + " is not empty",
                 s)
        }
      }

In the code above you have to:

 * define the `apply` method (and its somewhat complex signature)

 * use the protected `result` method to return: a Boolean condition, a message when the match is ok, a message when the
   match is not ok, the "expectable" value. Note that if you change the expectable value you need to use the `map` method
   on the `s` expectable (`s.map(other)`). This way you preserve the ability of the Expectable to throw an Exception if
   a subsequent match fails

 * you can use the `description` method on the `Expectable` class to return the full description of the expectable including
   the optional description you setup using the `aka` method

#### Matching with a sequence of values

If you have the same "MatchResult" expression that you'd like to verify for different values you can write one of the following:

        // stop after the first failure
        ((_:Int) must be_>(2)).forall(Seq(3, 4, 5))

        // try to match all values and collect the results
        ((_:Int) must be_>(2)).foreach(Seq(3, 4, 5))

        // succeeds after the first success
        ((_:Int) must be_>(2)).atLeastOnce(Seq(3, 4, 5))

#### Matchers for Option / Either

There are several matchers to check Option and Either instances:

 * `beSome` checks if an element is Some(_)
 * `beSome.which(function)` checks if an element is Some(_) and satisfies a function returning a boolean
 * `beSome.like(partial function)` checks if an element is Some(_) and satisfies a partial function returning a `MatchResult`
 * `beNone` checks if an element is None
 * `beAsNoneAs` checks if 2 values are equal to None at the same time
 * `beRight` checks if an element is Right(_)
 * `beRight.like(partial function)` checks if an element is Right(_) and satisfies a partial function returning a `MatchResult`
 * `beLeft` checks if an element is Left(_)
 * `beLeft.like(partial function)` checks if an element is Left(_) and satisfies a partial function returning a `MatchResult`

#### String matchers

Matching on strings is very common. Here are the matchers which can help you:

 * `beMatching` (or ` be matching`) checks if a string matches a regular expression
 * `=~(s)` is a shortcut for `beMatching(".*"+s+".*")`
 * `find(exp).withGroups(a, b, c)` checks if some groups are found in a string
 * `have length` checks the length of a string
 * `have size` checks the size of a string (seen as an `Iterable[Char]`)
 * `be empty` checks if a string is empty
 * `beEqualTo(b).ignoreCase` checks if 2 strings are equal regardless of casing
 * `beEqualTo(b).ignoreSpace` checks if 2 strings are equal when trimmed
 * `beEqualTo(b).ignoreSpace.ignoreCase` you can compose them
 * `contain(b)` checks if a string contains another one
 * `startWith(b)` checks if a string starts with another one
 * `endWith(b)` checks if a string ends with another one

#### Numeric matchers

Less often you need to do comparisons on Numerical values:

 * `beLessThanOrEqualTo` compares any Ordered type with `<=`
    `1 must be_<=(2)`
    `1 must beLessThanOrEqualTo(2)`

 * `beLessThan` compares any Ordered type with `<`
    `1 must be_<(2)`
    `1 must beLessThan(2)`

 * `beGreaterThanOrEqualTo` compares any Ordered type with `>=`
    `2 must be_>=(1)`
    `2 must beGreaterThanOrEqualTo(1)`

 * `beGreaterThan` compares any Ordered type with `>`
    `2 must be_<(1)`
    `2 must beGreaterThan(1)`

 * `beCloseTo` checks if 2 Numerics are close to each other
    `1.0 must beCloseTo(1, 0.5)`
    `4 must be ~(5 +/- 2)`

#### Exception matchers

***specs2*** offers very compact ways of checking that some exceptions are thrown:

 * `throwA[ExceptionType]` checks if a block of code throws an exception of the given type
 * `throwA[ExceptionType](message = "boom")` additionally checks if the exception message is as expected
 * `throwA(exception)` or `throwAn(exception)` checks if a block of code throws an exception of the same type, with the
    same message
 * `throwA[ExceptionType].like { case e => e must matchSomething }` or
   `throwA(exception).like { case e => e must matchSomething }` allow to verify that the thrown exception satisfies a property
 * `throwA[ExceptionType](me.like { case e => e must matchSomething }` or
   `throwA(exception).like { case e => e must matchSomething }` allow to verify that the thrown exception satisfies a property

For all the above matchers you can use `throwAn` instead of `throwA` if the exception name starts with a vowel for better
readability.

#### Iterable matchers

Iterables can be checked with several matchers:

  * to check if the iterable is empty
    `Nil must be empty`
    `List(1, 2, 3) must not be empty`

  * to check if some elements are contained in the iterable
    `List(1, 2, 3) must contain(3, 2)`

  * to check if some elements are contained in the iterable in the same order
    `List(1, 2, 3, 4) must contain(2, 4).inOrder`

  * to check if only some elements are contained in the iterable
    `List(4, 2) must contain(2, 4).only`

  * to check if only some elements are contained in the iterable and in the same order
    `List(2, 4) must contain(2, 4).only.inOrder`

  * to check the size of an iterable
    `List(1, 2) must have size(2)`
    `List(1, 2) must have length(2)` // equivalent to size

  * to check if an `Iterable[String]` contains matching strings
    `List("Hello", "World") must containMatch("ll")        // matches with .*ll.*`
    `List("Hello", "World") must containPattern(".*llo")   // matches with .*llo`

  * to check if an `Iterable[String]` contains matching strings, but only once
    `List("Hello", "World") must containMatch("ll").onlyOnce`

  * to check if one of the elements has a given property
    `List("Hello", "World") must have(_.size >= 5)`

  * to check if an iterable has the same elements as another one, regardless of the order
    `List("Hello", "World") must haveTheSameElementsAs(List("World", "Hello"))`

#### Map matchers

Maps have their own matchers as well, to check keys and values:

  * `haveKey` checks if a Map has a given key
    `Map(1 -> "1") must haveKey(1)`

  * `haveValue` checks if a Map has a given value
     `Map(1 -> "1") must haveValue("1")`

  * `havePair` checks if a Map has a given pair of values
    `Map(1 -> "1") must havePair(1 -> "1")`

  * `havePairs` checks if a Map has some pairs of values
    `Map(1->"1", 2->"2", 3->"3") must havePairs(1->"1", 2->"2")`

But Maps are also Partial Functions, so:

  * `beDefinedAt` checks if a PartialFunction is defined for a given value
    `partial must beDefinedAt(1)`

  * `beDefinedBy` checks if a PartialFunction is defined for a given value
    and returns another one
    `partial` must beDefinedBy(1 -> true) 

#### Xml matchers

It is very useful to have literal Xml in Scala, it is even more useful to have matchers for it!

  * `beEqualToIgnoringSpace` compares 2 Nodes, without considering spaces
    `<a><b/></a> must ==/(<a> <b/></a>)`
    `<a><b/></a> must beEqualToIgnoringSpace(<a> <b/></a>)`

  * `beEqualToIgnoringSpace` can also do an ordered comparison
    `<a><c/> <b/></a> must ==/(<a> <c/><b/></a>).ordered`

  * `\` is an XPath-like matcher matching if a node is a direct child of another
    `<a><b/></a> must \("b")`

  * You can also check attribute names
    `<a><b name="value"></b></a> must \("b", "name")`

  * And attribute names and values as well
    `<a><b n="v" n2="v2" n3="v3"></b></a> must \("b", "n"->"v", "n2"->"v2")`

  * The equivalent of `\` for a "deep" match is simply `\\`
    `<a><s><c></c></s></a> must \\("c")`

#### Json matchers

[Json](www.json.org) is a simple data format essentially modeling recursive key-values. There are 2 matchers which can be
used to verify the presence of appropriate values in Strings representing Json documents:

  * `/(value)` checks if a value is present at the root of the document. This can only be the case if that document is
    an Array

  * `/(key -> value)` checks if a pair is present at the root of the document. This can only be the case if that document is
    a Map

  * `*/(value)` checks if a value is present anywhere in the document, either as an entry in an Array, or as the value
    for a key in a Map

  * `*/(key -> value)` checks if a pair is present anywhere in a Map of thedocument

Now the interesting part comes from the fact that those matchers can be chained to search specific paths in the Json document.
For example, for the following document:

        // taken from an example in the Lift project
        val person = {
          "person": {
            "name": "Joe",
            "age": 35,
            "spouse": {
              "person": {
                "name": "Marilyn",
                "age": 33
              }
            }
          }
        }

You can use these combinations:

       person must /("person") */("person") /("age" -> 33.0) // by default numbers are parsed as Doubles

#### File matchers

The Java api for files is more or less mimicked as matchers which can operate on strings denoting paths or on Files:

  * `beEqualToIgnoringSep` checks if 2 paths are the same regardless of their separators
    `"c:\\temp\\hello" must beEqualToIgnoringSep("c:/temp/hello")`
  * `beAnExistingPath` checks if a path exists
  * `beAReadablePath` checks if a path is readable
  * `beAWritablePath` checks if a path is writable
  * `beAnAbsolutePath` checks if a path is absolute
  * `beAHiddenPath` checks if a path is hidden
  * `beAFilePath` checks if a path is a file
  * `beADirectoryPath` checks if a path is a directory
  * `havePathName` checks if a path has a given name
  * `haveAsAbsolutePath` checks if a path has a given absolute path
  * `haveAsCanonicalPath` checks if a path has a given canonical path
  * `haveParentPath` checks if a path has a given parent path
  * `listPaths` checks if a path has a given list of children
  * `exist` checks if a file exists
  * `beReadable` checks if a file is readable
  * `beWritable` checks if a file is writable
  * `beAbsolute` checks if a file is absolute
  * `beHidden` checks if a file is hidden
  * `beAFile` checks if a file is a file
  * `beADirectory` checks if a file is a directory
  * `haveName` checks if a file has a given name
  * `haveAbsolutePath` checks if a file has a given absolute path
  * `haveCanonicalPath` checks if afile has a given canonical path
  * `haveParent` checks if a file has a given parent path
  * `haveList` checks if a file has a given list of children

#### Scalaz matchers

It was useful to check some Scalaz properties during the development of ***specs2*** so they are available as matchers:

 * `semigroup.isAssociative` checks if a `Semigroup` respect the associativity law
 * `monoid.hasNeutralElement` checks if a `Monoid` zero value is really a neutral element
 * `monoid.isMonoid` checks if a `Monoid` has a neutral element and respects the associativity rule

Note that you need to extend the `ScalaCheck` trait if you want to use these matchers in a specification.

#### Result matchers

That's only if you want to match the result of other matchers!

        // you need to extend the ResultMatchers trait
        class MatchersSpec extends Specification with ResultMatchers { def is =
          "beMatching is using a regexp" ! {
            ("Hello" must beMatching("h.*")) must beSuccessful
          }
        }

#### Scala Interpreter matchers

This trait is not included in the default specification so you'll have to add it in the rare case where you want to use
the Scala interpreter and execute a script:

        class ScalaInterpreterMatchersSpec extends Specification with ScalaInterpreterMatchers {
          def interpret(s: String): String = // you have to provide your own Scala interpreter here

          "A script" can {
            "be interpreted" in {
               "1 + 1" >| "2"
            }
          }
        }

#### Parser matchers

Scala provides a parsing library using [parser combinators](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers.html).

You can specify your own parsers by:

 * extending the `ParserMatchers` trait
 * defining the `val parsers` variable with your parsers definition
 * use the `beASuccess`, `beAFailure`, `successOn`, `failOn`, `errorOn` matchers to specify the results of parsing input
   strings
 * use `haveSuccessResult` and `haveFailureMsg` to specify what happens *only* on success or failure. Those matchers accept
   a String or a matcher so that
   . `haveSuccessResult("r") <==> haveSuccessResult(beMatching(".*r.*") ^^ ((_:Any).toString)`
   . `haveFailingMsg("m") <==> haveFailingMsg(beMatching(".*r.*"))`

For example, specifying a Parser for numbers could look like this:   

        import util.parsing.combinator.RegexParsers
        import NumberParsers.{number, error}

        class ParserSpec extends Specification with matcher.ParserMatchers {  def is =
          "Parsers for numbers"                                                                   ^
                                                                                                  p^
          "beASuccess and succeedOn check if the parse succeeds"                                  ^
          { number("1") must beASuccess }                                                         ^
          { number must succeedOn("12") }                                                         ^
          { number must succeedOn("12").withResult(12) }                                          ^
          { number must succeedOn("12").withResult(equalTo(12)) }                                 ^

                                                                                                  end

          val parsers = NumberParsers
        }
        object NumberParsers extends RegexParsers {
          /** parse a number with any number of digits */
          val number: Parser[Int] = "\\d+".r ^^ {_.toInt}
          /** this parser returns an error */
          val error: Parser[String] = err("Error")
        }

### ScalaCheck properties

A clever way of creating expectations in ***specs2*** is to use the [ScalaCheck](http://code.google.com/p/scalacheck) library.

To declare ScalaCheck properties you first need to extend the `ScalaCheck` trait. Then you can pass functions to the `check` method
and use the resulting block as your example body:

      "addition and multiplication are related" ! check { (a: Int) => a + a == 2 * a }

The function that is checked can either return:

      // a Boolean
      "addition and multiplication are related" ! check { (a: Int) => a + a == 2 * a }

      // a MatchResult
      "addition and multiplication are related" ! check { (a: Int) => a + a must_== 2 * a }

      // a Prop
      "addition and multiplication are related" ! check { (a: Int) => (a > 0) ==> (a + a must_== 2 * a) }

Note that if you pass functions using MatchResults you will get better failure messages so you are encouraged to do so.

#### Arbitrary instances

By default `Arbitrary` instances are taken from the surrounding example scope. However you'll certainly need to generate
your own data from time to time. In that case you will create an Arbitrary instance and make sure it is in the scope
of the function you're testing:

        // this arbitrary will be used for all the examples
        implicit def a = Arbitrary { for { a <- Gen.oneOf("a", "b"); b <- Gen.oneOf("a", "b") } yield a+b }

        "a simple property" ! ex1

         def ex1 = check((s: String) => s must contain("a") or contain("b"))

You can also be very specific if you want to use an `Arbitrary` instance only on one example. In that case, just replace the
`check` method with the name of your `Arbitrary` instance:

        "a simple property"       ! ex1
        "a more complex property" ! ex2

        implicit def abStrings = Arbitrary { for { a <- Gen.oneOf("a", "b"); b <- Gen.oneOf("a", "b") } yield a+b }
        def ex1 = abStrings((s: String) => s must contain("a") or contain("b"))

        // use a tuple if there are several parameters to your function
        def ex2 = (abStrings, abStrings)((s1: String, s2: String) => s must contain("a") or contain("b"))

#### Setting the ScalaCheck properties

ScalaCheck test generation can be tuned with a few properties. If you want to change the default settings, you have to use
implicit values:

      implicit val params = set(minTestsOk -> 20) // use display instead of set to get additional console printing

It is also possible to specifically set the execution parameters on a given property:

      "this is a specific property" ! check { (a: Int, b: Int) =>
        (a + b) must_== (b + a)
      }.set(minTestsOk -> 200, workers -> 3)

The parameters you can modify are:

  * `minTestsOk`: minimum of tests which must be ok before the property is ok (default=100)
  * `maxDiscarded`: if the data generation discards too many values, then the property can't be proven (default=500)
  * `minSize`: minimum size for the "sized" data generators, like list generators (default=0)
  * `maxSize`: maximum size for the "sized" data generators (default=100)
  * `workers`: number of threads checking the property (default=1)

### Mock expectations

At the moment only the [Mockito](http://mockito.org) library is supported.

Mockito allows to specify stubbed values and to verify that some calls are expected on your objects. In order to use those
functionalities, you need to extend the `org.specs2.mock.Mockito` trait:

      import org.specs2.mock._
      class MockitoSpec extends Specification { def is =

         "A java list can be mocked"                                                    ^
           "You can make it return a stubbed value"                                     ! c().stub^
           "You can verify that a method was called"                                    ! c().verify^
           "You can verify that a method was not called"                                ! c().verify2^
                                                                                        end
         case class c() extends Mockito {
           val m = mock[java.util.List[String]] // a concrete class would be mocked with: mock(new java.util.LinkedList[String])
           def stub = {
             m.get(0) returns "one"             // stub a method call with a return value
             m.get(0) must_== "one"             // call the method
           }
           def verify = {
             m.get(0) returns "one"             // stub a method call with a return value
             m.get(0)                           // call the method
             there was one(m).get(0)            // verify that the call happened
           }
           def verify2 = there was no(m).get(0) // verify that the call never happened
         }
       }

##### Stubbing

Stubbing values is as simple as calling a method on the mock and declaring what should be returned or thrown:

      m.get(1) returns "one"
      m.get(2) throws new RuntimeException("forbidden")

You can specify different consecutive returned values by appending thenReturns or thenThrows:

      m.get(1) returns "one" thenReturns "two"
      m.get(2) throws new RuntimeException("forbidden") thenReturns "999"

##### Argument matchers
The built-in Mockito argument matchers can be used to specify the method arguments for stubbing:

      m.get(anyInt()) returns "element"
      m.get(999) must_== "element"

***specs2*** matchers can also be passed directly as arguments:

      m.get(be_==(123)) returns "one"      

##### Callbacks

In some rare cases, it is necessary to have the return value depend on the parameters passed to the mocked method:

      m.get(anyInt) answers { i => "The parameter is " + i.toString }

The function passed to answers will be called with each parameter passed to the stubbed method:

     m.get(0)           // returns "The parameter is 0"
     m.get(1)           // the second call returns a different value: "The parameter is 1"

###### Parameters for the answers function

Because of the use of reflection the function passed to answers will receive only instances of the `java.lang.Object` type.

More precisely, it will:

 * pass the mock object if both the method has no parameters and the function has one parameter:
   `mock.size answers { mock => mock.hashCode }`
 * pass the parameter if both the method and the function have one parameter:
   `mock.get(0) answers ( i => i.toString )`
  * pass the parameter and the mock object if the method has 1 parameter and the function has 2:
    `mock.get(0) answers { (i, mock) => i.toString + " for mock " + mock.toString }`

In any other cases, if `f` is a function of 1 parameter, the array of the method parameters will be passed and if the
function has 2 parameters, the second one will be the mock.

##### Verification

By default Mockito doesn't expect any method to be called. However if your writing interaction-based specifications you
want to specify that some methods are indeed called:

       m.get(0)
       m.get(0) was called
       m.get(1) wasnt called
       m.get(2) was notCalled

###### Constraints on call expectations

You can be even more precise when specifying the number of calls on a mock:

      there was one(m).get(0)              // one call only to get(0)
      there was no(m).get(0)               // no calls to get(0)

      // were can also be used
      there were two(m).get(0)             // 2 calls exactly to get(0)
      there were three(m).get(0)           // 3 calls exactly to get(0)
      there were 4.times(m).get(0)         // 4 calls exactly to get(0)

      there was atLeastOne(m).get(0)       // at least one call to get(0)
      there was atLeastTwo(m).get(0)       // at least two calls to get(0)
      there was atLeastThree(m).get(0)     // at least three calls to get(0)
      there was atLeast(4)(m).get(0)       // at least four calls to get(0)

      there was atMostOne(m).get(0)        // at most one call to get(0)
      there was atMostTwo(m).get(0)        // at most two calls to get(0)
      there was atMostThree(m).get(0)      // at most three calls to get(0)
      there was atMost(4)(m).get(0)        // at most four calls to get(0)

It is also possible to add all verifications inside a block, when several mocks are involved:

      got {
        one(m).get(0)
        two(m).get(1)
      }
###### Order of calls

The order of method calls can be checked by creating calls and chaining them with then:

      val m1 = mock[List[String]]
      val m2 = mock[List[String]]

      m1.get(0)
      m1.get(0)
      m2.get(0)

      there was one(m1).get(0) then one(m1).get(1)

      // when several mocks are involved, the expected order must be specified as an implicit value
	    implicit val order = inOrder(m1, m2)
      there was one(m1).get(0) then one(m2).get(0)

###### Spies

Spies can be used in order to do some "partial mocking" of real objects:

      val spiedList = spy(new LinkedList[String])

      // methods can be stubbed on a spy
      spiedList.size returns 100

      // other methods can also be used
      spiedList.add("one")
      spiedList.add("two")

      // and verification can happen on a spy
      there was one(spiedList).add("one")

However, working with spies can be tricky:

     // if the list is empty, this will throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException
     spiedList.get(0) returns "one"

As advised in the Mockito documentation, doReturn must be used in that case:

     doReturn("one").when(spiedList).get(0)

### DataTables

DataTables are a very effective way of grouping several similar examples into one. For example, here is how to specify the
addition of integers by providing one example on each row of a table:

      class DataTableSpec extends Specification with DataTables { def is =
        "adding integers should just work in scala"  ! e1

        def e1 =
          "a"   | "b" | "c" |                                   // the header of the table, with `|` separated strings
           2    !  2  !  4  |                                   // an example row
           1    !  1  !  2  |> {                                // the > operator to "execute" the table
           (a, b, c) =>  a + b must_== c                        // the expectation to check on each row
        }
      }

Note that there may be implicit definition conflicts when the first parameter of a row is a String. In that case you
can use the `!!` operator to disambiguate (and `||` in the header for good visual balance).

### Forms

Forms are a way to represent domain objects or service, and declare expected values in a tabular format. They are supposed
to be used with the HtmlRunner to get human-readable documentation.

Forms can be designed as reusable pieces of specification where complex forms can be built out of simple ones.

  "Here's " ~ ("how to use Forms", new org.specs2.guide.Forms)                                                          ^
"""

### Reusing matchers outside of specs2

The ***specs2*** matchers are a well-delimited piece of functionality that you should be able to reuse in your own test
framework. You can reuse the following traits:

 * `org.specs2.matcher.MustMatchers` (or `org.specs2.matcher.ShouldMatchers`) to write anything like `1 must be_==(1)` and
   get a `Result` back

 * You can also use the side-effecting version of that trait called `org.specs2.matcher.MustThrownMatchers` (or `ShouldThrownMatchers`).
   It throws a `FailureException` as soon as an expectation is failing. Those traits can also be used in a regular
   Specification if you have several expectations per example and if you don't want to chain them with `and`.

 * Finally, in a JUnit-like library you can use the `org.specs2.matcher.JUnitMustMatchers` trait which throws
   `AssertionFailureError`s
