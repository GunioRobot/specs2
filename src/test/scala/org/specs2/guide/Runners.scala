### Presentation

<toc/>

There are 4 ways to execute ***specs2*** specifications:

 * on the command line, with a console output, and the `specs2.run` runner
 * on the command line, with an html output, and the `specs2.html` runner
 * on the command line, with a console or an html output, and the `specs2.files` runner
 * using [sbt](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool)
 * using [JUnit](http://www.junit.org)

### Dependencies

 ***specs2*** is only available with Scala 2.8.1 onwards and uses the following libraries, as specified using the [sbt dsl](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/LibraryManagement#Basic_Dependencies):

#### Arguments

You can specify arguments which will control the execution and reporting. They can be passed on the command line, or declared
inside the specification:

      class MySpec extends Specification { def is = args(noindent=true) ^
        "Clever spec title"                                             ^
        "this will not be indented"                                     ^
        "brilliant expectation"                                         ! success
      }

The available arguments are the following:

  Name           | Default value | Description
 --------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 `ex`            | .*            | regular expression specifying the examples to execute. Use `ex .*brilliant.*` on the command line
 `xonly`         | false         | only reports failures and errors
 `plan`          | true          | only report the text of the specification without executing anything
 `failtrace`     | false         | report the stacktrace for failures
 `color`         | true          | use colors in the output (`nocolor` can also be used on the command line)
 `noindent`      | false         | don't indent automatically text and examples
 `showtimes`     | false         | show individual execution times
 `sequential`    | false         | don't execute examples concurrently
 `threadsNb`     | 0             | number of threads to use for concurrent execution
 `markdown`      | true          | interpret text as Markdown in the html reporter
 `debugMarkdown` | false         | print more information when Markdown formatting fails
 `html`          | false         | only to be passed on the command line to get console + html reporting at once
 `fromSource`    | true          | true takes an AutoExample description from the file, false from the expectation ok message


All those arguments are usually set in a specification with `args(name=value)` but there are some available shortcuts:

 Name                                                      | Equivalent                                                           | Description                                                                                      |
 ---------------                                           | -----------------------                                              | -----------                                                                                      |
 `plan`                                                    | `args(plan=true)`                                                    |                                                                                                  |
 `noindent`                                                | `args(noindent=true)`                                                |                                                                                                  |
 `xonly`                                                   | `args(xonly=true)`                                                   |                                                                                                  |
 `only(examples: String)`                                  | `args(ex=examples)`                                                  |                                                                                                  |
 `sequential`                                              | `args(sequential=true)`                                              |                                                                                                  |
 `literate`                                                | `args(noindent=true, sequential=true)`                               | for specifications where text must not be indented and examples be executed in order              |
 `freetext`                                                | `args(plan=true, noindent=true)`                                     | for specifications with no examples at all and free display of text                              |
 `descFromExpectations`                                    | `args(fromSource=false)`                                             | create the example description for the ok message of the expectation instead of the source file  |
 `diffs(show, separators, triggerSize, shortenSize, full)` | `args(diffs=Diffs(show, separators, triggerSize, shortenSize, full)` | to display the differences when doing equality comparison                                        |

For the diffs arguments the values you can specify are:

  * `show` will not show anything (default is true)
  * `separators` allows to change the separators used to show the differences (default is "[]")
  * `triggerSize` controls the size above which the differences must be shown (default is 20)
  * `shortenSize` controls the number of characters to display around each difference (default is 5)
  * `full` displays the full original expected and actual strings

### Console output

Executing a specification `com.company.SpecName` in the console is very easy:

`scala -cp ... specs2.run com.company.SpecName [argument1 argument2 ...]`

##### Colors

By default, the reporting will output colors. If you're running on windows you might either:

 * use the [following tip](http://www.marioawad.com/2010/11/16/ansi-command-line-colors-under-windows) to install colors in the DOS console
 * or pass `nocolor` as a command line argument

### Html output

If you want html pages to be produced for your specification you'll need to execute:

`scala -cp ... specs2.html com.company.SpecName [argument1 argument2 ...]`

By default the files will be created in the `target/specs-report` directory but you can change that by setting the
`-Dspecs2.outDir` system property.

### Files Runner

The `specs2.files` object will, by default, select and execute Specifications found in the test source directory:

 * the source directory is defined as `src/test/scala` but can be changed by adjusting the system property `specs2.srcTestDir`
 * the specifications files are selected as classes or object which names match `.*Spec`. This value can be changed by
   passing a different `specName` value as a command-line argument
 * `console` or `html` has to be passed on the command-line to specify which kind of output you want

You can also extend the `org.specs2.runner.FilesRunner` trait and override its behavior to implement something more appropriate
to your environment if necessary.

### Simple build tool

In order to use ***specs2*** with sbt you need first to add the following lines to your sbt project:

      def specs2Framework = new TestFramework("org.specs2.runner.SpecsFramework")
      override def testFrameworks = super.testFrameworks ++ Seq(specs2Framework)

Then, depending on the naming of your specification, you have to specify which classes you want to include for reporting:

      override def includeTest(s: String) = { s.endsWith("Spec") || s.contains("UserGuide") }

##### arguments

When you execute one test only, you can pass the arguments on the command line:

      > test-only org.specs2.UserGuide -- xonly

The `html` argument is also available with sbt to allow the creation of the html report from the command line.

      > test-only org.specs2.UserGuide -- html

##### Files runner

Any `FilesRunner` object can also be invoked by sbt, but you need to specify `console` or `html` on the command line:

      > test-only allSpecs -- console

##### Colors

Note the the color support for sbt on Windows is a bit tricky. You need to follow the instructions [here](http://www.marioawad.com/2010/11/16/ansi-command-line-colors-under-windows) then add to your script launching sbt:

        -Djline.terminal=jline.UnsupportedTerminal

### JUnit

It is possible to have ***specs2*** specifications executed as JUnit tests. This enables the integration of ***specs2*** with
Maven and the JUnit runners of your IDE of choice.

There are 2 ways of enabling a Specification to be executed as a JUnit test: the verbose one and the simpler one. The
simple one is to extend `SpecificationWithJUnit`:

       class MySpecification extends SpecificationWithJUnit {
         def is = // as usual....
       }

You can use the second one if your IDE doesn't work with the first one:

      import org.junit.runner._
      import runner._

      @RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner])
      class MySpecification extends Specification {
         def is = // as usual....
      }

[*some [tricks](http://code.google.com/p/specs/wiki/RunningSpecs#Run_your_specification_with_JUnit4_in_Eclipse) described on the specs website can still be useful there*]
